        <h1>Macarthur Reilly</h1>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I’m a graphic designer, illustrator, and marketing strategist known for developing visually distinctive brands that are both memorable and meaningful. My work blends bold color, expressive illustration, and conceptual thinking to create identities that immediately stand out while remaining strategically aligned with a company’s goals. Rather than designing for aesthetics alone, I focus on visual storytelling — building cohesive brand systems that communicate personality, values, and purpose at a glance. My style is recognizable, but never generic; it adapts to elevate each brand while maintaining a level of originality that drives attention and differentiation in competitive markets.

What I bring to the table goes beyond design execution. I approach every project through a marketing lens, considering audience behavior, positioning, and long-term brand equity. My skill set includes brand identity development, digital illustration, campaign design, content strategy, and cross-platform visual systems. I understand how to translate creative concepts into measurable impact — whether that’s stronger engagement, clearer messaging, or increased brand recognition. I don’t just create visuals; I build strategic assets that help companies connect, grow, and compete with confidence.</p>
